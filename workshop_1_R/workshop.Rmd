```{R}

# flights, airports, airlines, planes, weather
```

## Installation

Google it.

## Loading data

```{R}
# set working directory so R knows where to look for data
setwd("/Users/mm40078/Documents/projects/datafest2016/data/")

# read a csv into a dataframe
# type ?read.csv into the console to view the help docs
workshops <- read.csv("workshops.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, strip.white = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA", "NULL", ""), sep = ",")
workshops

workshops[2,] # 2nd row
workshops$pronouns # pronouns column

# give the num_pets column to the sum() function, returns the sum
# na.rm to remove NAs from the sum - otherwise, output is just NA (try it!)
sum(workshops$num_pets, na.rm = TRUE)

# sometimes it's nice to assign things to a variable
# if we're going to use them multiple times
x <- workshops$num_pets
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
median(x, na.rm = TRUE)

# what is the unit of observation?
# how would we change the unit of observation to a person?


# factors, strings, numeric (basic types), missing


# basic data structs (data frames)
# lists, vectors
# head, tail, indexing
# save as .rda
# load packages
library(nycflights13) # load a package with data (not useful for datafest)

# sampling
```

## Getting help

```{R}
# ?
# basic googling search terms
# CRAN
# how to read documentation
```

## More looking at data

```{R}

# summary stats
# column names
# hist, xy scatterplot, pairs plot
# correlations
```

## Subsetting columns

```{R}
x[is.na(x)] <- 0
```

## Cleaning columns



## Saving

```{R}
# write.csv
```
