## Getting help

```{R, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# INSTALL and LOAD packages
#   put a ? in front of a package, function, dataset, to get info on it
?install.packages()
install.packages() # you install a package only once
?library
library() # load packages you need at the beginning of every script

# PRINT something to your console, can be useful for debugging
print("this might come in handy")

# FREE DATA THAT COMES WITH R
#   see what datasets are available
data()
#   if the dataset doesn't have a period in it, load it like this
data("women")
?women # get info on the dataset
#   if the dataset has a period in it (ie state.region, state.name), load it like this
data("state")
?state # info on the dataset includes all the subtables of state (region, name)
```

## Loading data

```{R, echo=TRUE}
# set working directory so R knows where to look for your project files
setwd("/Users/mm40078/Documents/projects/datafest2016/data")

# read a csv into a dataframe, use ?read.csv to understand the options!
workshops <- read.csv("workshops.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, strip.white = TRUE, na.strings = c("NA", "NULL", ""), sep = ",")

# print the dataframe to console (ugly)
workshops
# view the dataframe in a nice window
View(workshops)

# randomly sample the data, check out ?sample
x <- sample(nrow(workshops), size = 3)
x
workshops_sample <- workshops[x, ]
```

## Looking at data

```{R, echo=TRUE}
names(workshops) # column names
nrow(workshops) # number of rows
ncol(workshops) # number of columns
head(workshops, n = 2) # top 2 rows
tail(workshops, n = 1) # bottom row
workshops[2,] # 2nd row
workshops[,3] # pronouns column
workshops[2:nrow(workshops),] # 2nd - last row
workshops[, c("pronouns","gender")] # get columns in list
workshops$pronouns # easier way to access pronouns column

# the unique function gives you unique values in a thing.... check out ?unique
```

## Filtering data

```{R, echo=TRUE}
# BASIC EXAMPLES
#     this returns a list of booleans
workshops$first_name == "galen"
#     this returns a df with filtered rows
workshops[workshops$first_name == "galen",]
#     the which function tells you the index of "TRUE" values for a filter
which(workshops$first_name == "galen", arr.ind = TRUE)
#     use grepl to search within strings-- this finds columns with `name` contained in the column name
workshops[, grepl("name", names(workshops), ignore.case = TRUE)]

# MORE ADVANCED EXAMPLES
#   rows where `num_pets` > 0 and `gender` is non-male
workshops[(workshops$num_pets > 0 
           & ! is.na(workshops$num_pets)
           & workshops$gender != "male")
          , 1:6]
#   let's say you want to change some of the column names
#     get the index of the column name and then reassign the value
gender_idx <- which(names(workshops) == tolower("gender"), arr.ind = TRUE) 
names(workshops)[gender_idx] <- "sex_assigned_at_birth"
names(workshops)[which(names(workshops) == "last_NAME", arr.ind = TRUE)] <- "last_name"
#   let's say you want to manually overwrite grace's worst_trait in the dataframe
#     find which row grace is and then reassign the value
grace_row <- which(workshops$first_name == tolower("grace"), arr.ind = TRUE)
workshops[grace_row, "worst_trait"] <- "has no flaws"
```

## Data types & missing values

```{R, echo=TRUE}
# as.<TYPE> converts the types of vectors
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
as.character(x)

# there are other 'as' functions:
?as.date
?as.numeric

# if you get weird errors with factors, make sure
# you set stringsAsFactors to FALSE in read.csv

# WHEN TO REMOVE NAs
#   STATS ON NUMERIC VARIABLES
#   get the sum, mean, median of the number of pets
x <- workshops$num_pets
sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
median(x, na.rm = TRUE)

```

## Aggregating

``` {R, echo=TRUE}
# Q: what is the unit of observation? in other words, what does a row represent?
# A: a row represents a person teaching a workshop (so if someone teaches 2 workshops, they'll be listed twice)

# Q: how would we change the unit of observation to a person?
# A: one solution is the aggregate function (?aggregate)

# using aggregate() with the formula parameter
try_agg1 <- aggregate(formula = . ~ first_name + last_name, data = workshops, FUN = paste)
# um.... where did freddie and galen go? what aspects of these rows could have caused their data to disappear?
# they were the only rows with NA values... something weird is going on, let's fix it
try_agg2 <- aggregate(formula = . ~ first_name + last_name, data = workshops, FUN = paste, na.action = na.pass)
# ok now that that's fixed, why does this make useless aggregations like this: c("lizard", "lizard")... ???
# it's because FUN = paste blindly pastes everything while aggregating; make a better function for aggregation
smarter_paste <- function(x){
  paste(unique(x))
}
try_agg3 <- aggregate(formula = . ~ first_name + last_name, data = workshops, FUN = smarter_paste, na.action = na.pass)

```

## Summary stats

```{R, echo=TRUE}
# NUMERIC summary stats
mean(workshops$num_pets, na.rm = TRUE) # exclude NAs
median(workshops$num_pets, na.rm = TRUE)
min(workshops$num_pets, na.rm = TRUE)
max(workshops$num_pets, na.rm = TRUE)
sum(is.na(workshops$num_pets))
#   does all of the above and more
summary(workshops$num_pets)

# CATEGORICAL 
#   treat categorical as strings, not numbers
workshops$workshop_code <- as.character(
  workshops$workshop_code)
#   finding unique values of a categorical variable can be very useful
unique(workshops$workshop_name)
```

## Saving data

```{R, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# save an .rda which can only be used in R
save(workshops, file = "your-file-path")

# save a .csv
write.csv(workshops, file = "your-file-path")
```

## Thanks!
